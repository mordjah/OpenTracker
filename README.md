OpenTracker
===========

Testing and Baby steps for now, but this will eventually
be a reimplementation of Zoneminder with support for openni
devices as well as the usual stuff

This is on the way to a home automation setup with voice/gesture/face/person recog and response
...eventually

Note that as of this moment there is nothing here save my scribblings as I attempt to understand the apis
and maven /ant / netbeans interaction on Gentoo/64.

Currently using a modified freenect to provide the motor subdevice (thats a todo for sure, as its just public accessors now)
  wil need to be pared down to just provide motor/led control.
OpenNI 1.5.2 for the goodies,
and Nite on top for gesture (and hopefully finger tracking..)

I Plan to package this all up in a Gentoo repo at some point since it was a pita to install.

I wil keep the readme up to date.
